FlowPulse is a python package allows you to visualize your measures of flow as well as to run Monte Carlo Simulations based your data. It supports various datasources, from CSV files to Jira or Azure DevOps.
While csv is the most flexible datasource, the connection to your Jira or Azure DevOps will allow you to run it continuously with the latest data. The true power of Flow Metrics and Forecasts comes when inspected on a regular base. The point of collecting data is to take action, so use this to make informed decisions about what you want to adjust! You can use this for free, we hope it helps you in your efforts to reach a better flow.
