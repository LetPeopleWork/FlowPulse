Right now, flowpulse supports three data sources:

- TOC
{:toc}

Each of them comes with different configuration options. Check out the [Configuration](../../configuration/configuration.html) section for details on the configuration. This section will give you an overview over the specifics of each data source.

# CSV
CSV files are nice because almost any tool has some kind of export that will allow you to export it in this format. To make flowpulse work, you need a CSV file that has an identifier for your work item (for example an ID)
