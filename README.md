This python package allows you to visualize your measures of flow as well as to run Monte Carlo Simulations based on the data in your Jira or Azure DevOps Backlog. All it needs is a connection to your [Jira](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html) or [Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows) and the queries to your backlog. Feel free to check out the code, propose improvements and also make it your own by adjusting it to your context and potentially integrating it into some kind of pipeline of yours. The true power of Flow Metrics comes when inspected on a regular base. The point of collecting data is to take action, so use this to make informed decisions about what you want to adjust! You can use this for free, hope it helps.

This tool is provided for free by [LetPeopleWork](https://letpeople.work). If you are curious about Flow Metrics, Kanban, #NoEstimates etc., feel free to reach out to us via [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/let-people-work/shared_invite/zt-2y0zfim85-qhbgt8N0yw90G1P~JWXvlg)
